# Welcome to my world ðŸ˜‰
I am Pan Gong, a 4th year computer science student at Dalhousie University. Before that, I got my physics degree in China.
Why choose computer science? 
Because I like it and there, I can solve a real-world problem using what I learned rather than using physics-theoretical formulas to model motion laws.

I would like to contribute to a better world through software development.
